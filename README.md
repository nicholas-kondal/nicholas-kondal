### 👋 Hi! I'm Nicholas Kondal

I'm a Biomedical Engineering and Physics student who, as of mid-2020, has decided to extend his degree by 2 years to study Computer Science because of a desire to pursue an interdisciplinary exploration of the human mind 🧠, the universe 🌌, and everything in between (especially doggos 🐶).

There's not much on here at the moment but I'll be uploading all my university projects as well as my final-year Engineering honours project in a few months!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on multi-class classification of time-series brain signals using machine learning algorithms in Python
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about ML pipelines, data science, and test-driven development
- 📫 How to reach me: [GitHub](https://github.com/nickykay98/) (you're already here!) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-kondal/)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've been collecting LEGO for 13 years and have no intention of stopping.

I also dabble(d) in writing blogs:

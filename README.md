### 👋 Hi! I'm Nicholas Kondal

I'm a Biomedical Engineering and Physics student who, as of mid-2020, has decided to extend his degree by 2 years to study Computer Science because of a desire to pursue an interdisciplinary exploration of the human mind 🧠, the universe 🌌, and everything in between (especially doggos 🐶).

There's not much on here at the moment but I'll be uploading all my university projects as well as my final-year Engineering honours project in a few months!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about ML pipelines, data science, and test-driven development
- 📫 How to reach me: [GitHub](https://github.com/nickykay98/) (you're already here!) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-kondal/)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've been collecting LEGO for 13 years and have no intention of stopping.

Projects which I've worked on:
- Engineering Honour's thesis on multi-class classification of time-series brain signals using machine learning algorithms in Python
- Hackathons including the [Google Developer Student Club hackathon](https://devpost.com/software/qualia) (1st place! 🏆), [MYOB IT Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRvTa27t5fE&t=203s) (another 1st place! 🥇) and others from AUCS and the FoE

Projects which I may or may not be working on currently 🤫:
- Open-source contributions to libraries dealing with human pose estimation from images 🤺
- Web development in Python using Flask and Django 💻
- Creating software for robots in space 🌌

I also dabble(d) in writing blogs:
